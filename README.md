# rzoo
Pure rust implementation of Rahul Dhesis zoo archiver

## History
zoo is a data compression program and format developed by Rahul Dhesi in the mid-1980s.
The format is based on the LZW compression algorithm and compressed files are identified by the .zoo file extension.

## Regarding this port.
This attempts to be pure Rust port of the source code of zoo 2.10-3 (found here: http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/compress/zoo-2.10-3.src.rpm).
Selection of Rust was for maximum portability and speed.
